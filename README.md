# EcoVision
Higher education institutions struggle to monitor and reduce campus energy usage due to inefficiencies, limited real-time visibility, and a lack of data-driven insights. These gaps lead to higher operational costs and an increased carbon footprint. This project aims to solve these issues by developing an integrated smart energy management solution.
